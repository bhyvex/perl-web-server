<h1> Pure Perl Web Server </h1>

<p> Version 1.0.1 </p>

<p> This is an <u>alpha release</u> </p>

<h2> What this is </h2> 

<p> This is an exercise in Perl, to get experience with the raw Sockets and Forking.
This is also a brush up on C, as most of the functions in Perl to do these actions are very similar
to their C language counterparts.
</p>

    <h2> Features: </h2>

The server will create a child process to handle each request.  Once a connection is made,
the parent will fork and delegate a child process to actually fulfill the request on the connection.
Leaving the main server to process connections only.
